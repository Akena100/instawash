Car Vacuuming / Hooving
What it involves

The dirt in the unreachable parts of your car can be so irritating and uncomfortable. When you rust our expert team. sit back & forget about the stubborn odor that makes your car interior atmosphere uncomfortable. Re-Vacuuming is done just after the initial vacuuming. Any dirt left in the interior cabin, glove compartment, dash board & underneath the seats is removed and windows wiped clean.

Remove any Removable: Floor mats, carpets, seat covers and any other moveable

materials should come out every time you vacuum. You can also look into removing the middle console, the door panels, or even the seats, in case of a deep clean if they're easily taken out.
Use Air: Vacuum intake and outtake are both user friendly methods when cleaning a car's interior. Al lnsta wash Uganda we use traditional intake vacuums to clean up the worst debris/ clutter and reverse the air flow, this is done by the use of an air compressor to blow out the harder to reach places.
Clean the Vents: Using a compressor or a can of air to blow the dust out of the vent slats is one idea, as experts we also use a toothbrush, cotton swab, electronic drilling brush with a long, narrow reach, or to individually clean each vent hole.
Long-Reach Dusters: At insta wash Uganda we use the long reach dusters while under taking minor vacuuming jobs, that do not require heavy-duty detailing equipment. These work best when you just want to wipe away a build-up of dirt rather than provide a deep clean.

Background
As a general cleaning company, our ultimate goal is to be the lead one stop solution to all hygiene, sanitation and waste/ garbage collection management challenges in the - whole of Uganda. lnsta Trash is one of the subsidiaries of lnsta wash Uganda making up the 5th department of the company.
According to Kampala City Council Authority, it is estimated that the per capita generation of garbage is one kilogram per day. With a population of about 1.5 million, this works out to about 1500 tons of garbage collected from households and commercial entities per day.
However, because almost 80% of - the garbage is organic matter, it makes it very bulky to handle, allowing the city authority in its current capacity to ably manage disposing off 40%
- 50% of the total garbage - in the whole of Kampala city. This leaves the other 50-60% to private contractors to supplement
As the country's population grows, the economy equally develops creating a number of inventions which in turn increase the amount
of waste in the communities. The extension of the cities into residential areas has made garbage disposal quite a challenge con tributing to an unhealthy environment, risking the health of the inhabitants.
With recurring presence of this challenge, lnsta trash has been created to provide timely garbage disposal services while considering the client's ability to contribute to comm unity health development while building a healthy culture
lnsta trash provides all first-time clients with free two in one garbage bins and bin bags as an incentive to facilitate the smooth process of waste disposal and recycling requirements.

RESIDENCE & HOME CARE CLEANING SERVICES
Insta Wash Ug	27
Background
As life gets busier and with the desire to establish a better living, pursue career goals, make ends meet etc., looking good, smart, elegant, and presentable becomes very crucial. With all these desires in mind, having clean laundry at all times has become vital. Today, most people opt for their residential drop in laundry wash ladies who come in on a given day to clean the laundry, others collect all the laundry in one basket and drop it at the dry cleaners', a few who can afford to acquire laundry machines do so, as others hire resident house-helps/ maids whose responsibility is to clean laundry and run other house chores.

Much as most of these alternatives have proven efficient over the years, they have posed various challenges with maids & drop in laundry wash ladies being inefficient due to various unbearable circumstances, workload, bad attitudes, and sometimes poor health. This lack of consistency makes it inconvenient to the home/house owners & the hustle of having to drop and pick the laundry can be very frustrating as well. While most people would
prefer to acquire laundry machines, the

cost of purchase, maintenance, and operating the machines can be rather too high. With the invention of multi-purpose digital laundry machines, lnsta Wash Uganda through research embraced the utilization of recent technology making it possible to bring laundry management services right at the client's door step. This new invention has presented the best alternative to using traditional laundry management methods. Our new laundry management approach is effective, convenient & trusted, giving our clients an opportunity to attain value for money as well as redeem time.

We therefore care for our clients' satisfaction hence the provision of professional and high-quality laundry services at the convenience of our clientele.
